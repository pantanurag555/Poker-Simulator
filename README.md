# Poker Simulator
I often found while playing that my friends and I would get confused as to who had the winning hand in the game. This program was developed by me to be the final authority in matters of such a close call.<br><br>
Texas Hold-em Poker rules apply. The game comprises of 5 house cards with 2 pocket cards given to each player. Maximum 9 players are allowed to play in one hand.<br><br>
Card entry format is mentioned at the beginning of the program.<br><br>
##What the Program Does
<ul>
<li>Checks card entry to make sure that no card has been entered twice using a hash table
<li>Finds the winner of the poker hand dealt
<li>In case of a tie, gives name of the winners among who the pot is to be divided
<li>Finds the type of hand with which the player or players won
</ul>
